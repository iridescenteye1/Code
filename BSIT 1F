We think of a farm mostly in terms of area of land, quality of soil, assorted crops and domestic ani- mals, having, generally speaking, little concep- tion of the really vital thing about it, namely, the adaptation, selection and adjustment of these factors which result in farm organisation. Much is heard about small farms, medium-sized farms, and large farms, yet the '^ large'' farm spoken of may be a small business, as compared with the business done on a ** small' farm. A potato-and-truck farm about one and one-half miles from Louisville, Kentucky, has an area of fifty-four acres, some of it under glass. Seven men are employed the year around and five work animals. \
                      \nOne team is kept busy in hauling stable-manure from the city, while nearly every day some farm-product is hauled to mar- ket. On a wheat farm in a western State, two men and twelve horses operate about one thou- sand acres of land. The fifty-four-acre farm near Louisville, however, is the larger business, in that more capital is required to run it, the expenses are greater, and the gross receipts greater. The farm near Louisville is valued at $700 per acre, while the thousand acres of wheat- land is valued at $15 per acre. How the Census Bureau Defines a Farm. — The Standard Dictionary defines a farm as follows : **A tract of land under one control or forming a single property devoted to agriculture, stock raising, dairy-products, or some allied indus- try.''

Some men make a practice of obtaining good soils in a well-fed and good yielding condition, and by spending little and taking much, add to their banking accounts. Finally they leave the farm depleted of its growing power and full of weeds. Some 'out-farmers', even when the soil is depleted, will stay on, remaining to attack the skeleton. This type of farming is not always 'greed', but the result of economic pressure. Thus the number of out-farmed farms are continually increasing and adding to the unfortunate position.

A plant’s ability to feed itself, through photosynthesis, enables it to produce the chemical and physical components necessary for growth,  maintenance, storage, defense (because, of course, it can’t run from predators), and to reproduce so the species is successful. \
                       \n \nA plant species’ anatomy and physiology are fine-tuned to its ecological niche, and support an individual’s ability to grow, defend, and survive in its place. For example, in grasslands—which includes many grazing animals within the ecological system, plant species need to be resilient. the anatomy of a grass plant allows it to be munched to the ground without preventing it from resprouting, growing, or reproducing (if you mow a lawn, you are acting like a grazer). trees, on the other hand, would not be able to withstand grazing in the same way as grasses. For this reason, we mow around young tree seedlings planted in lawns. However, trees have their own unique set of adaptations that enable them to thrive in their own particular ecological niche. \
                       \n \nEach plant organ has a specific role in a functioning plant which varies in importance throughout the plant’s vegetative and reproductive stages of life. Depending on the stage of the life cycle the plant is in, plant organs carry out a variety of important functions.  ")

But the farmer is also an important member of the society in which he is living. He has a responsibility as a member of that society, and the functioning of the world about him affects his business as well as the living conditions of his family. Consequently, the problems confronting the farmer in organizing and operating his business are considered in the setting of the farmer as a member of the society in which he is living.\
                        \nFarming is the oldest vocation of civilized man. Even today more people in this world are engaged in farming than in any other way of earning a living. The proportion of farmers to the total population, however, has been gradually reduced in the highly industrialized nations. Machines and other improvements in farming have made it possible for fewer people to grow the food for larger and larger populations. This has meant that more people could produce those goods and services other than food which we enjoy as a part of our living today. The shift to other occupations in this country from 1870 to 1940 is shown in figure 1. \
                        \nAlthough the United States is now one of the more highly industrialized nations, about 28,000,000 out of our present population of 134,000,000 live on farms.

                        \n\n   Every family, therefore, may have a garden. If there is not a foot of land, there are porches or windows. Wherever there is sunlight, plants may be made to grow; and one plant in a tin-can may be a more helpful and inspiring garden to some mind than a whole acre of lawn and flowers may be to another. \
                        \n\n   The satisfaction of a garden does not depend on the area, nor, happily, on the cost or rarity of the plants. It depends on the temper of the person. One must first seek to love plants and nature, and then to cultivate the happy peace of mind that is satisfied with little. \
                        \n\n   In the vast majority of cases a person will be happier if he has no rigid and arbitrary notions, for gardens are moodish, particularly with the novice. If plants grow and thrive, he should be happy; and if the plants that thrive chance not to be the ones that he planted, they are plants nevertheless, and nature is satisfied with them. \
                        \n\n   We are wont to covet the things that we cannot have; but we are happier when we love the things that grow because they must. A patch of lusty pigweeds, growing and crowding in luxuriant abandon, may be a better and more worthy object of affection than a bed of coleuses in which every spark of life and spirit and individuality has been sheared out and suppressed. The man who worries morning and night about the dandelions in the lawn will find great relief in loving the dandelions. Each blossom is worth more than a gold coin, as it shines in the exuberant sunlight of the growing spring, and attracts the insects to its bosom. Little children like the dandelions: why may not we? Love the things nearest at hand; and love intensely. If I were to write a motto over the gate of a garden, I should choose the remark that Socrates is said to have made as he saw the luxuries in the market, “How much there is in the world that I do not want!” \
                        \n\n   I verily believe that this paragraph I have just written is worth more than all the advice with which I intend to cram the succeeding pages, notwithstanding the fact that I have most assiduously extracted this advice from various worthy but, happily, long-forgotten authors. Happiness is a quality of a person, not of a plant or a garden; and the anticipation of joy in the writing of a book may be the reason why so many books on garden-making have been written. Of course, all these books have been good and useful. It would be ungrateful, at the least, for the present writer to say otherwise; but books grow old, and the advice becomes too familiar. The sentences need to be transposed and the order of the chapters varied, now and then, or interest lags. Or, to speak plainly, a new book of advice on handicraft is needed in every decade, or perhaps oftener in these days of many publishers.")

                      \n Nevertheless, soil testing is vital, since the pH level of your soil will determine what macronutrients and micronutrients are available for your plants. The lesson is that plants, like people, need adequate shelter and access to good “food.” \
                      \n\n Your standard soil analysis will provide you with information about your soil’s three most important macronutrients: nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous. Calcium is sometimes included in this analysis, and you can often request information about other nutrients, like magnesium, sulfur, and iron, for a fee. \
                      \n\n{Fore.YELLOW}{Style.BRIGHT}SOIL COLLECTION{Style.RESET_ALL} \
                      \n\n Depending on your extension agency, you might be able to collect the soil yourself and send it in. If you take this route, the best time to test is in October or November, leaving you time to make adjustments and plan for your spring garden. \
                      \n\n To collect the soil, you’ll need a trowel (or some other digging tool) and a bucket. You should dig out a hunk of soil about six inches deep. That hunk doesn’t really matter, so dump it somewhere. \
                      \n\n Now you’ll need to collect a profile slice of the dirt and toss it in the bucket. (This allows you to capture a picture of the whole root zone.) Repeat this process six more times throughout your garden and then mix all of those samples in your bucket. Finally, you can bag this concoction and ship it off for analysis. All you’ve got left to do is await the results and apply the recommended amendments.")

                      \n\n Soil and Water - Know Before You Grow \
                      \n\nBefore you begin your project, it is important that you test the soil and test the water. This can be done through the local health department, state agencies (such as Department of Agriculture or Farm Bureau) or local universities. The reason to test is because the quality of the water and soil has a direct impact on the quality of the plants you grow and the health and safety of your students. Be aware of this requirement when planning your timeline - it can sometimes take up to 1 month to get soil results back. \
                      \nSome communities have large deposits of heavy metals such as lead that MUST be abated before you can grow. You may be in a situation where you must import soil for a raised bed or hoop house because of the heavy metals. Also, knowing the pH level and existing nutrient content will provide a roadmap to what types of compost and fertilizer/enrichments need to be added to the soil to maximize its growing potential. \
                      \nLead is toxic to the nervous system especially among young children and this is a critical issue for schools. Lead is naturally present in all soils and may have a background level of 5 ppm to 40 ppm but there are a number of variables that can cause it to become higher. \
                      \n\n Water Considerations \
                      \n\n Water quality is also integral to the success of your school garden. Similar to the soil, some communities have chemicals in the water (such as chlorine) which will affect the pH levels in the water. There are ways to balance the pH both naturally and through conventional methods. Be familiar with the quality and safety of the water source that will be used in your garden. If you get your water from a municipal or public water system you can assume that it is safe and drinkable (potable). If the water is from a well it must be tested annually to make sure it meets the Environmental Protection Agency Standards. Make sure all water used in the garden for any purpose, including irrigation (watering), hand washing, cleaning of garden tools and equipment, is drinkable (potable) water.")
